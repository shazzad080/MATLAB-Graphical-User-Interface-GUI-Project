# Digital Logic & Digital Modulation Simulator 🔌⚡

Hey there! Welcome to my MATLAB-based simulator that makes learning digital logic and modulation actually fun and interactive.

## What's This All About?

Ever struggled to visualize how logic gates work or what digital modulation looks like? I built this app to solve exactly that problem. It's a hands-on tool where you can click buttons, see truth tables pop up instantly, watch waveforms dance across your screen, and actually *understand* what's happening under the hood.

Think of it as your personal digital electronics playground, built right in MATLAB.

## Cool Stuff You Can Do

### Play with Logic Gates 🎮
Jump into the Digital Logic Design tab and you'll find:
- **All Your Favorite Gates**: AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, XOR, XNOR - they're all here
- **Instant Truth Tables**: Click a gate, boom! Truth table appears
- **Live Waveforms**: See exactly how signals flow through your circuit in real-time
- **K-map Tools**: Simplify your logic designs like a pro

### Explore Digital Modulation 📡 *(Work in Progress)*
The modulation side is still cooking, but here's what's coming:
- **Pick Your Modulation**: Try ASK, PSK, or FSK and see how they differ
- **Feed It Binary Data**: Type in your own bit sequences
- **Beautiful Visualizations**: Watch your data transform into waveforms, constellation diagrams, and eye diagrams
- **Tweak Parameters**: Play with amplitude, phase, and other settings to see what changes

## Why I Built This

Honestly? Textbooks can be boring. Formulas are great, but seeing things in action? That's where the magic happens. This simulator is designed to:
- Make complex concepts click in your brain
- Give you a safe space to experiment without breaking anything
- Help you actually *see* what you're learning about
- Turn study sessions into something you might actually enjoy

## Getting Started (It's Easy!)

### What You'll Need
- MATLAB installed on your computer (anything from R2019a onwards works great)
- That's pretty much it!

### Setting It Up
1. Grab the code from this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/digital-logic-modulation-simulator.git
   ```
2. Fire up MATLAB
3. Navigate to where you saved the files
4. Open the `.mlapp` file in App Designer
5. Hit that run button and you're good to go!

## How to Use It

### Logic Gates Are Your Friends
1. Click on the **Digital Logic Design** tab
2. Pick any gate that catches your eye (maybe start with AND?)
3. Watch the truth table generate itself
4. Check out those sweet waveforms showing inputs and outputs

### Modulation Station (Coming Soon!)
1. Head over to the **Digital Modulation** tab
2. Choose a modulation type (ASK is pretty cool for beginners)
3. Type in some binary numbers (like 101010)
4. Adjust the knobs and sliders
5. Marvel at the diagrams that pop up

## Quick Logic Gate Cheat Sheet

Here's what each gate does in plain English:

| Gate | What It Does |
|------|--------------|
| **AND** | Only says "yes" when EVERYONE says "yes" |
| **OR** | Says "yes" if ANYONE says "yes" |
| **NOT** | The rebel - always does the opposite |
| **NAND** | AND gate having a bad day (opposite of AND) |
| **NOR** | OR gate's evil twin (opposite of OR) |
| **XOR** | Only happy when inputs disagree |
| **XNOR** | Only happy when inputs match |

## Current Status

- ✅ **Logic Gates**: All done! Play away!
- 🚧 **Modulation**: Working prototype, more features coming

## Who Can Use This?

Perfect for:
- Students trying to ace Digital Electronics
- Anyone learning Communication Systems
- Self-learners who prefer hands-on practice
- Teachers looking for cool demos
- That friend who always asks "but how does it ACTUALLY work?"

## About Me

I'm **Shazzad Ahmed**, an EEE student at Islamic University of Technology (ID: 220021108). I made this for my MATLAB Simulation Lab course, but honestly, I wanted to create something that would've helped *me* when I was first learning this stuff.

**P.S.** The modulation module is still baking in the oven. It works, but I'm adding more features to make it even cooler. Stay tuned!

**Made with 💙 and lots of debugging sessions**
